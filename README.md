#Abstract
As technology continues to advance, the medical industry has increasingly turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to leverage its capabilities in improving healthcare outcomes. One of the key advantages of AI, particularly machine learning, lies in its ability to extract valuable insights from 
the vast volumes of health data generated daily. This wealth of data, coupled with advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and high-performance computing, presents unprecedented opportunities to optimize public health efforts while mitigating the strain on limited human resources. 
This study focuses on the development of a diabetes prediction model, which holds significant promise in addressing a pressing global health concern. Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by abnormal blood sugar levels, is influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental elements. By analyzing both common parameters such as blood sugar levels, body mass index (BMI), age, and insulin, as well as external factors contributing to diabetes development, this model aims to provide accurate categorization and prediction of diabetes onset. 
The analysis draws upon two distinct datasets, namely the PIMA India and Sylhet datasets, which offer diverse sets of demographic and clinical information. Leveraging machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier (NB), and decision trees, the study 
endeavors to create robust prediction models capable of accurately classifying individuals into diabetic and non-diabetic categories. 
By harnessing the power of these machine learning techniques and comprehensive datasets, this research seeks to advance our understanding of diabetes onset and pave the way for more targeted interventions, personalized treatment plans, and ultimately, improved public health outcomes.
